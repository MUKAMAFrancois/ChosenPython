# Merge Sort is a popular and efficient sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer strategy. 
# It works by recursively dividing the input array into two halves,
# sorting each half, and then merging the sorted halves back into a single sorted array.


# Here's how the Merge Sort algorithm works:

# 1. **Base Case**: If the input array contains zero or one element, it is already sorted by definition, so return the array itself.

# 2. **Divide**: If the input array contains more than one element, divide it into two halves by calculating the middle index.

# 3. **Conquer**: Recursively sort the two halves by calling the Merge Sort function on each half.

# 4. **Merge**: Once the two halves are sorted, merge them into a single sorted array by iterating through the two halves and comparing their elements. The smaller element is added to the final sorted array, and the process continues until all elements from both halves are merged.

# Here's an example implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm in Python:


def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr

    # Divide the array into two halves
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left_half = arr[:mid]
    right_half = arr[mid:]

    # Recursively sort the two halves
    left_half = merge_sort(left_half)
    right_half = merge_sort(right_half)

    # Merge the sorted halves
    return merge(left_half, right_half)

def merge(left, right):
    merged = []
    left_idx = right_idx = 0

    # Merge the sorted halves into a single sorted array
    while left_idx < len(left) and right_idx < len(right):
        if left[left_idx] <= right[right_idx]:
            merged.append(left[left_idx])
            left_idx += 1
        else:
            merged.append(right[right_idx])
            right_idx += 1

    # Append remaining elements from the non-empty half
    merged.extend(left[left_idx:])
    merged.extend(right[right_idx:])

    return merged

# Example usage
unsorted_list = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 3, 7, 4, 6]
sorted_list = merge_sort(unsorted_list)
print(sorted_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]


# In this implementation, the `merge_sort` function recursively divides the input array into two halves until the base case is reached (arrays of length 0 or 1).
# The `merge` function is responsible for merging the sorted halves into a single sorted array.

# The time complexity of Merge Sort is O(n log n) in the average and worst cases, 
# making it an efficient sorting algorithm for large datasets. 
# This time complexity is due to the divide-and-conquer approach and the linear-time merging process.

# Merge Sort has several advantages:

# 1. **Stability**: Merge Sort is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning it preserves the relative order of equal elements in the input array.
# 2. **Efficiency**: The time complexity of O(n log n) is efficient for most practical cases, and the algorithm performs well on large datasets.
# 3. **Space Complexity**: While Merge Sort requires additional space proportional to the input size for the merging process, it can be optimized to operate in-place, reducing the space complexity.
# 4. **Parallelization**: Merge Sort can be easily parallelized, as the division and merging steps can be performed independently on different processors or cores.

# Merge Sort is widely used in various applications, including:

# - External sorting, where data is too large to fit entirely in memory
# - Implementing other algorithms, such as the Timsort algorithm used in Python's `sorted()` and `sort()` functions
# - Parallel computing and distributed systems, where data can be divided and sorted across multiple processors or nodes

# Overall, Merge Sort is a reliable and efficient sorting algorithm that is 
# widely used in computer science and programming due to its time complexity, stability, and ability to be parallelized.
