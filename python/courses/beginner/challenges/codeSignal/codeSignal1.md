3. Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.

Note: sequence a0, a1, ..., an is considered to be a strictly increasing if a0 < a1 < ... < an. Sequence containing only one element is also considered to be strictly increasing.

Example

For sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1], the output should be
solution(sequence) = false.

For sequence = [1, 3, 2], the output should be
solution(sequence) = true.

You can remove 3 from the array to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 2]. Alternately, you can remove 2 to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 3]




4. Let's say a triple (a, b, c) is a zigzag if either a < b > c or a > b < c.

Given an array of integers numbers, your task is to check all the triples of its consecutive elements for being a zigzag. More formally, your task is to construct an array of length numbers.length - 2, where the ith element of the output array equals 1 if the triple (numbers[i], numbers[i + 1], numbers[i + 2]) is a zigzag, and 0 otherwise.

Example

For numbers = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4], the output should be solution(numbers) = [1, 1, 0].

(numbers[0], numbers[1], numbers[2]) = (1, 2, 1) is a zigzag, because 1 < 2 > 1;
(numbers[1], numbers[2] , numbers[3]) = (2, 1, 3) is a zigzag, because 2 > 1 < 3;
(numbers[2], numbers[3] , numbers[4]) = (1, 3, 4) is not a zigzag, because 1 < 3 < 4


5. matrixElementsSum


After becoming famous, the CodeBots decided to move into a new building together. Each of the rooms has a different cost, and some of them are free, but there's a rumour that all the free rooms are haunted! Since the CodeBots are quite superstitious, they refuse to stay in any of the free rooms, or any of the rooms below any of the free rooms.

Given matrix, a rectangular matrix of integers, where each value represents the cost of the room, your task is to return the total sum of all rooms that are suitable for the CodeBots (ie: add up all the values that don't appear below a 0).

matrix = [[0, 1, 1, 2], 
          [0, 5, 0, 0], 
          [2, 0, 3, 3]]
the output should be
solution(matrix) = 9. There are several haunted rooms, so we'll disregard them as well as any rooms beneath them. Thus, the answer is 1 + 5 + 1 + 2 = 9.


For

matrix = [[1, 1, 1, 0], 
          [0, 5, 0, 1], 
          [2, 1, 3, 10]]
the output should be
solution(matrix) = 9.
Note that the free room in the final column makes the full column unsuitable for bots (not just the room directly beneath it). Thus, the answer is 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 9.


6. Given an array of strings, return another array containing all of its longest strings.

Example

For inputArray = ["aba", "aa", "ad", "vcd", "aba"], the output should be
solution(inputArray) = ["aba", "vcd", "aba"]


7. Given two strings, find the number of common characters between them.

Example

For s1 = "aabcc" and s2 = "adcaa", the output should be
solution(s1, s2) = 3.

Strings have 3 common characters - 2 "a"s and 1 "c".


8. 


Ticket numbers usually consist of an even number of digits. A ticket number is considered lucky if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half.

Given a ticket number n, determine if it's lucky or not.

Example

For n = 1230, the output should be
solution(n) = true;
For n = 239017, the output should be
solution(n) = false.


9. Some people are standing in a row in a park. There are trees between them which cannot be moved. Your task is to rearrange the people by their heights in a non-descending order without moving the trees. People can be very tall!

Example

For a = [-1, 150, 190, 170, -1, -1, 160, 180], the output should be
solution(a) = [-1, 150, 160, 170, -1, -1, 180, 190]


10. Write a function that reverses characters in (possibly nested) parentheses in the input string.

Input strings will always be well-formed with matching ()s.

Example

For inputString = "(bar)", the output should be
solution(inputString) = "rab";
For inputString = "foo(bar)baz", the output should be
solution(inputString) = "foorabbaz";
For inputString = "foo(bar)baz(blim)", the output should be
solution(inputString) = "foorabbazmilb";
For inputString = "foo(bar(baz))blim", the output should be
solution(inputString) = "foobazrabblim".
Because "foo(bar(baz))blim" becomes "foo(barzab)blim" and then "foobazrabblim".
